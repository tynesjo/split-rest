# Keyboard Layout

## Base Layer

> Key press-and-release effects when no modifiers are held

1. return and tab centrally located for thumbs
    * especially makes tab-completion much faster and more comfortable
2. increased spacing of two keys between home position of left and right hand
    * improved ergonomics through more straight wrists
    * makes modifier keys close to space bar easier to reach and better candidates for frequent use
3. alphabetic symbols match those of Colemak, as do comma and period
    * limits need to retrain from Colemak
4. apostrophe and colon avaiable without modifier
    * for VIM: colon to enter command-line mode, and apostrophe can be set to enter insert mode
    * escape avaiable on either hand without moving hands out of home-position
5. function keys brought one row down


## Numeric Layer

> Numerical digits and symbols often used in numerical contexts

![](images/numeric.png?raw=true)


* location of numerical digit optimised based on frequency of usage (typically 0 > 1 > ... > 9)

* numerical digits are located in a left-hand cluster
* middle row contains most frequenty used numbers
* bottom row has only odd digits, top only even ones
* modifier key for numerical layer is dedicated
* some non-numerical symbols also included to avoid unnecessary modifier-key switching
